# Design-Thinking-Project
As part of our Introduction to Machine Learning using Python module (Data Driven World), our team was tasked with defining a problem statement, finding datasets and arriving at a conclusion using Linear regression. The theme of the project was food security. Our team chose the problem statement: */ How might we predict the prevalence of undernourishment of a country given their poverty gap as a percentage of population, corruption perception index and primary energy consumption per GDP?*  
  
  
This project helped us understand Linear Regression with its advantages and disadvantages when modelling something as complex as global food security and segwayed us into the world of Machine Learning.
